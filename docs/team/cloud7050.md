## Overview

**ConText** is a desktop app that allows for managing contacts quickly via text commands, with useful features relevant to NUS SoC students.
While it has a Graphical User Interface, most of its user interactions happen via an in-app Command Line Interface.

## Summary of contributions

### Code contributed

[TP RepoSense Code Dashboard](https://nus-cs2103-ay2324s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=cloud7050&breakdown=true)

### Enhancements implemented

//TODO

### Contributions to the UG

- Merged AB3 UG contents back into the draft UG taken from our internal project document, to flesh it out, as the draft was a short one written from scratch before we were familiar with the documentation and code AB3 already came with.
- Made a full pass over the UG to add and update contents to match our project, enhancing it along the way.

Wrote sections:

- Introductory description
- Quick start
- Features
  - About command format
  - Add, edit, delete, find, filter
  - Clear, list, help, exit
  - Automatic sorting
  - Automatic saving
- Known limitations

Some of the aforementioned sections may have been initially drafted by others, or may have since been edited or added on to by others.

### Contributions to the DG

<!-- TODO may do a full pass over DG -->
<!-- TODO use cases -->
<!-- TODO appendix: instructions for manual testing -->
<!-- TODO appendix: effort -->
<!-- TODO appendix: planned enhancements -->

Wrote sections:

- Implementation
  - Maintaining sorting while supporting filtering
- Acknowledgements (merged/updated from `README.md` and `index.md`)
- Appendix: Requirements
  - Product scope (target user profile, value proposition)
  - Non-functional requirements

Some of the aforementioned sections may have been initially drafted by others, or may have since been edited or added on to by others.

### Contributions to team-based tasks

- Set up GitHub team org with permissions and invites. Set up repo with custom labels and user stories project board. Edited branch protections over time.
- Made team PR in main course repo with product description.
- Large amount of refactoring to help rename classes, methods, fields, variables, tests etc. to match our product.
- Renamed packages to match our product.
- Gradle:
  - Managed Gradle configs, editing them as needed (e.g. fixing config features deprecated in Gradle V8.3, config simplification, improving `clean` task, removing temporary workarounds, enabling assertions).
  - Updated and tested some dependencies.
  - Upgraded Gradle wrapper.
- Set up GitHub Pages Jekyll deployment.
- Set up Codecov.
- Extensively defined most tasks in the issue tracker over time. Managed milestones (some of which were split), labelled and kept track of work items, edited/assigned tasks, and kept the issue tracker up-to-date and tidy overall. Was very active in issue comments, such as adding details or meeting notes and linking relevant items.
- Helped perform some milestone wrapups before deadlines, following defined checklists.
- Helped tag, build, and create some releases as part of milestone wrapups or weekly project tasks.
- Helped keep track of meeting agendas and which tasks were pending assignment or further discussion. Helped create and link forum posts to seek clarifications from Prof.
- Helped track deliverables and ensure they were accomplished before their deadlines.
- Worked on sections of the UG/DG not about my own features or specific to anybody's features (described [above](#contributions-to-the-ug)).
- Updated `README.md`, `Ui.png`.
- Set up and maintained PR template to aid in reviewer and milestone assignment.
- Added and configured GitHub bot to automatically assign specific reviewers, with support for ignoring PRs under certain conditions.
- Performed some week-specific team tasks, e.g. triaging PE-D bugs, collating issue statistics into tutor's Teams message.
