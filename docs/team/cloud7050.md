## Overview

**ConText** is a desktop app that allows for managing contacts quickly via text commands, with useful features relevant to NUS SoC students.
While it has a Graphical User Interface, most of its user interactions happen via an in-app Command Line Interface.

## Summary of contributions

### Enhancements implemented

//TODO

### Contributions to the UG

- Merged AB3 UG contents back into the draft UG taken from our internal project document, to flesh it out, as the draft was a short one written from scratch before we were familiar with the documentation and code AB3 already came with.
- Made a full pass over the UG to add and update contents to match our project, enhancing it along the way.

Wrote sections:

- Introductory description
- Quick start
- Features
  - About command format
  - Add, edit, delete, find, filter
  - Clear, list, help, exit
  - Automatic sorting
  - Automatic saving
- Known limitations

Some of the aforementioned sections may have been initially drafted by others, or may have since been edited or added on to by others.

### Contributions to the DG

<!-- TODO may do a full pass over DG -->

- Acknowledgements (merged/updated from `README.md` and `index.md`)
